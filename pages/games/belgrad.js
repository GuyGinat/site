    <h2>Belgrad Park</h2>
    <p>Belgrad Park is a proof-of-concept project exploring a real-time-play horror game in a confined space. You are a true-crime podcaster investigating an abandoned Ranger Station in upstate New York where, twenty years ago, three park employees mysteriously vanished. In search of evidence that might bring this cold case back to life, you broke into the park for an overnight investigation and found yourself trapped in a never-ending time loop. Can you survive, escape the station, and uncover the terrible truth about what happened all those years ago?<br><br>
    The game was made in collaboration with the incredibley talented <a href="https://mandap.itch.io/" target="_blank">Amanda</a> and <a href="https://oykuyamako.itch.io/" target="_blank">Oyku</a>!
