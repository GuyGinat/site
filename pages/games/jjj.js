        <h2>Jiggle Jaggle Juggling</h2>
        <p>A small arcadey game made for Stuio I class at the NYU Game Center for a physics game assignment.<br>
        The game is meant to simulate the actual juggling experience.<br>
        The best tip I can give for that is to try and always have one ball in the air, just like real juggling.<br><br>
        There is also a leaderboard for the game, so you can check how good of a virtual juggler you are!
