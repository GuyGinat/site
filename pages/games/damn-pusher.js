<h2>You Damn Pusher</h2>
<p>Made through one weekend for a local multiplayer game class, You Damn Pusher is a 1v1 local multiplayer game where you and your friend are trying to push each other off the platform.<br>
The game is played with two controllers or a controller and a keyboard.<br>
A lot of the time making this game was spent on getting the sounds, colors and the feel of the game to feel like you are playing on an arcade cabinet.<br><br>
Music is by the amazing L'imperatrice (don't sue me please).
