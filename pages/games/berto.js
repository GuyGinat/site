        <p>Berto is a <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Keyboard Rage Game</span><br>
            <br>Berto is a game where you control a small pink thing, moving him across pillars<br>
            that correspond to keyboard keys, crossing difficult keyboard traversing gauntlets and badass boss fights.
            <br>The idea came from trying to utilize the whole keyboard, making it some sort of playground for your fingers
            <br><br>This is not a typing game
