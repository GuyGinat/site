        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Guy Ginat, and I am a game developer üëãüèΩ
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I'm currently doing an MFA in Game Design at the Game Center in NYU.<br>
            Before this, I was a lead developer at a small mobile games studio, and before that, a full stack developer at another startup.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I believe games are one of the most interesting ways to connect people, dream up worlds, tell stories, and simpley have fun.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This website is a collection of some of the games I've made, as well as some other projects I've worked on.<br>I hope you enjoy them!
        </p>
