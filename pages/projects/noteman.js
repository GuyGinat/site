<h2>Noteman</h2>
<p>Noteman is a little experiment in distributed data management.<br>
I came across this Javascript library called <a href="https://gun.eco/">Gun</a> that allows you to create a distributed database that can be synced between different clients.<br>
After making a couple of small chrome extensions, I wandered how they can be used in combination with Gun to allow web users to exchange ideas and preserve information on actual web pages.<br>
I hope you enjoy this little experiment, and if you have any ideas on how to improve it, please let me know.<br><br>
