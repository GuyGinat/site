            <h2>Pacific Drive Superlative UI/UX</h2>
            <p>This analysis was made as a part of my UI/UX studies, the assignment was to choose a game I found that 
            is doing UI/UX exceptionally well, the game I choose was Pacific Drive.<br>
            As I was putting together my presentation I came to need a presentation tool that would allow me to toggle on and off different layers of information I find relevant, 
            and how these layers interacted with each other. 
            </p>
            <h4>Controls:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Right and left arrow keys change slides</li>
                <li>Press S to toggle movement animation</li>
                <li>Press TAB to open the slide</li>
                <li>Scroll mouse to zoom in/out</li>
                <li>Drag to move around</li>
            </ul>
