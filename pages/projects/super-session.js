<h2>Super Session</h2>
<p>Super Session is one of my favorite tools I got to make over the years.<br>
The idea behind it was to make a tool that would allow me to search through my YouTube watch history by keywords, and then get the timestamps of the videos that contain those keywords.<br>
At the time I started making this I was learning a lot of different tools on YouTube, (Unity, Blender, Ableton, Adobe), I got tutorial fatigue, and it was getting hard to find older videos that I have watched before<br>
I was working as a web developer at a small startup that used <i>Elasitcsearch</i> for their search engine, so I thought I could use it to index my watch history.<br>
I made a chrome extension that would send to a local server the captions of the videos and a frontend webpage to view them.
<br>Therefore, this project is broken down to 3 different parts:<br>
<ul>
<li>Chrome extension that sends the captions of the videos to the server - <a href="https://github.com/GuyGinat/extended-ext-v3" target="_blank">github</a></li>
<li>Server that indexes the captions - <a href="https://github.com/GuyGinat/extnded-back" target="_blank">github</a></li>
<li>Frontend that allows you to search the captions - <a href="https://github.com/GuyGinat/extended-front" target="_blank">github</a></li>
